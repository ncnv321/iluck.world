              <h3>December 3, 2024</h3>
              <p>
              We found a bar that night, half-empty, playing old songs on the speakers. They didn't let us in because of my Canadian drivers license. <br>
              She told me stories about growing up in a town where no one left, about people she no longer talks to. I liked to trace the lines on her palm when she wasn't looking. I wonder if she noticed. <br>
              I'd look her in the eyes and tell her that we're two spirits bounded, tied to a million lifetimes. She told me she understood, but I think we both knew she didn't. <br>
              We started spending days together, like two kids playing at being adults, drinking coffee that turned cold while we talked about everything that wasn't important, and nothing that was. <br>
              She'd light a cigarette, and I'd pretend I wasn't counting the seconds between each inhale. <br>
              I never told her that I hated the smoke. It felt like a confession I wasn't ready to make. <br>
              The stars we saw that night weren't in the sky. They were in the spaces between our words, in the quiet moments where everything felt fragile and real.<br>
              To the nights that end with whispered confessions and the kind of silence that feels like understanding. <br>
              I wonder if memories know they're fading? If they feel the edges fraying, like an old photograph left in the sun. <br>
              We spent whole lifetimes in moments, until all the paths erased themselves again. <br>
              We rewrote our stories in reverse, unlearned the moments that made us, unspoken the words that broke us. <br>
              The heart is stubborn, but it remembers the shape of things, even when the details are gone.<br>
              Those moments were real to you, to me, they matter. Did we make good memories? <br>
